Chess Game Manager
==================

A Java-based chess game framework that models the chessboard and various chess pieces, handling their interactions, moves, and game logic. This repository is intended as a starting point for building chess applications or for educational purposes.

Overview
--------

This project provides an object-oriented approach to implementing chess game functionality in Java. The design includes separate classes for each type of chess piece, such as `Pawn`, `King`, `Queen`, and others, inheriting from a base `Piece` class. A `ChessBoard` class manages the board state, while a `Manager` class oversees game operations, such as setting up the board, handling turns, and enforcing rules.

Class Structure
---------------

The class structure is as follows:

- **Piece (Base Class)**: Abstract base class representing a chess piece, containing attributes and methods common to all pieces (like position and color).
  - **Pawn**: Derived from `Piece`, implements movement and special rules for pawns.
  - **King**: Derived from `Piece`, contains logic for king-specific moves (such as castling).
  - **Rook**: Derived from `Piece`, defines movement rules for rooks.
  - **Bishop**: Derived from `Piece`, defines movement rules for bishops.
  - **Knight**: Derived from `Piece`, defines movement rules for knights.
  - **Queen**: Derived from `Piece`, combines movement rules of both the rook and bishop.

- **ChessBoard**: Class responsible for managing the state of the board, initializing the pieces, and keeping track of positions.

- **Manager**: Oversees the game operations, such as turn-taking, win/loss conditions, and move validation.

- **Tester**: Contains test cases for validating the functionality of individual classes and overall game behavior.
